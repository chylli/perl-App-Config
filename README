NAME
    App::Config::Chronicle - An OO configuration module which can be changed
    and stored into chronicle database.

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        my $app_config = App::Config::Chronicle->new;

DESCRIPTION
    This module parses configuration files and provides interface to access
    configuration information.

FILE FORMAT
    The configuration file is a YAML file. Here is an example:

        system:
          description: "Various parameters determining core application functionality"
          isa: section
          contains:
            email:
              description: "Dummy email address"
              isa: Str
              default: "dummy@mail.com"
              global: 1
            admins:
              description: "Are we on Production?"
              isa: ArrayRef
              default: []

    Every attribute is very intuitive. If an item is global, you can change
    its value and the value will be stored into chronicle database by
    calling the method "save_dynamic".
